# NgTdForms
Handling user input with forms is the cornerstone of many common applications. Applications use forms to enable users to log in, to update a profile, to enter sensitive information, and to perform many other data-entry tasks.

Angular provides two different approaches to handling user input through forms: `reactive` and `template-driven`. Both capture user input events from the view, validate the user input, create a form model and data model to update, and provide a way to track changes.

`Reactive` and `template-driven` forms process and manage form data differently. Each offers different advantages.

## Template-driven Forms

In general: Template-driven forms are useful for adding a simple form to an app, such as an email list signup form. They're easy to add to an app, but they don't scale as well as reactive forms. If you have very basic form requirements and logic that can be managed solely in the template, use template-driven forms.

## Project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.4 for learning Template-driven forms.

## How to use

* Run "npm install" inside this project folder to install all dependencies.

* Make sure you use the latest version of the CLI (upgrade guide below)

* Run "ng serve" to see the app in action (try "npm start" in case "ng serve" fails).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
